                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Green iguanas cause costly damage by burrowing into structures, destroying native plants, contaminating water sources, and competing with native wildlife. They can carry salmonella and other diseases harmful to humans and pets.

                  Report sightings to help track populations, remove food sources from your property, use iguana-resistant plants, and support professional removal efforts. Early detection and community action are key to controlling their spread.

                  A single female iguana can lay up to 76 eggs per year, and populations can double in just 2-3 years if left unchecked. They're most active during South Florida's dry season (November-April).
